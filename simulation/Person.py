    """
    This class models the behavior of a person in a grid world with disease 
    propagation. 

    Location and Movement
    ---
    A person spawns on the grid with a randomly chosen coordinate location. 
    Specifically, the xy-coordinate is sampled from a Uniform(-1,1) 
    distribution. Whenever the person moves in the grid, they get a random
    velocity vector and "walk" in that direction. This is based on how fast the
    person can walk, and the random velocity vector is sampled from a Norm(0,1)
    distribution. Movement is "bounded" to within the box [-1,1]x[-1,1], so a
    person can't just walk off the map.
    
    NOTE: A DEAD person does not move.

    Status
    ---
    A person is either one of four mutually exclusive statuses with respect to
    the disease:

        * SUSCEPTIBLE. This person does not have the disease, but can catch it.
        * INFECTIVE. This person has the disease and can infect others.
        * REMOVE. This person does not have the disease and is immune to it. 
        * DEAD. This person is dead.

    Disease transmission is stochastic, but the probability that a SUSCEPTIBLE 
    person contracts the disease is given by
    \[
        (1 - (1 - \\alpha)^n_{r})
    \]
    where $n_{r}$ is the number of people within a radius $r$ from the person, 
    and $\\alpha$ is an underlying infectivity parameter. 

    Recovery from the disease, immunization, loss of immunization, and fatality
    are all stochastic as well, but this is determined exclusively by the 
    respective parameters given by the model.

    A note to folks new to Python. Every* object method passes an additional
    parameter, self, into the call. The parameter self is the object instance,
    which allows us to access its attributes (and other methods). In general, 
    when you see 
        def method(self):
            ...
    this means that in a script, you can write ClassObject.method()

    * This is not strictly true. Some methods do not need the self parameter,
    but every method here does.
